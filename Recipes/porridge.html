        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Yam Porridge can also be referred to as yam soup. It is mainly yam cooked with ingredients and the resulting dish contains some soupy liquid. 
            It is usually not cooked with added vegetables but I always add a little to add some green colour to the meal .</p>
