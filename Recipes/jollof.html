            <ol>
                <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 350°. Grease a 9"-x-13" baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, Scotch bonnet pepper, chopped onions, and bell peppers. Add 1 cup of stock, and blend until smooth.
                     Pour mixture into a large pot and bring to boil. Turn the heat down, partially cover the pot, 
                     and let simmer for about 10 to 12 minutes, until reduced to approximately 2 to 2 1/2 cups.</li>
                <li>In a separate large pan, heat oil over medium heat, and add the sliced onions. Season with salt,
                     and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes.
                     Add the bay leaves, curry powder, paprika, dried thyme, ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper. 
                     Cook over medium heat for about 1 minute to let the spices bloom. Add the tomato paste, and stir for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the reduced tomato-pepper-Scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and cook over medium heat for about 10 to 12 minutes,
                     or until the mixture is reduced by half.</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup of the stock to the mixture and bring to a boil for about 1 - 2 minutes.</li>

                <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with foil, and bake until the rice is tender, about 40 to 50 minutes. Check the rice after about 30 minutes,
                 and add water or stock if it looks dry or the rice is still hard. Fluff with a fork before serving.</li>
